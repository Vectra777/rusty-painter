//! # Wayland
//!
//! **Note:** Windows don't appear on Wayland until you draw/present to them.
//!
//! By default, Winit loads system libraries using `dlopen`. This can be
//! disabled by disabling the `"wayland-dlopen"` cargo feature.
//!
//! ## Client-side decorations
//!
//! Winit provides client-side decorations by default, but the behaviour can
//! be controlled with the following feature flags:
//!
//! * `wayland-csd-adwaita` (default).
//! * `wayland-csd-adwaita-crossfont`.
//! * `wayland-csd-adwaita-notitle`.
